BlueETL
=======

Multiple simulations analysis tool.


Introduction
============

``BlueETL`` is a package that can help analyse multiple simulations in a Simulation Campaign.

It relies on `BluePy <https://bbpteam.epfl.ch/documentation/projects/bluepy/latest/>`__ for accessing simulation and circuit data;
in the future it may switch to `Blue Brain SNAP <https://bluebrainsnap.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`__.


Reporting issues
================

``BlueETL`` is maintained by the BlueBrain NSE team.

Should you face any issue with using it, please submit a ticket to our `issue tracker <https://bbpteam.epfl.ch/project/issues/browse/NSETM>`__.
